## COP3530_Project_3: Run-length encoding vs huffman coding
We'll be comparing the space efficiency of different lossless video compression algorithms and comparing them by simulating streaming videos at a certain download speed and seeing which compression algorithm allows for smoother streaming.

Note: We are only using uncompressed AVI videos as inputs. This is so that the only compression being applied to the video is the algorithms we apply. AVI is also a simple container that shouldn't be too hard to use for this case
