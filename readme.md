## COP3530_Project_3: Run-length encoding vs huffman coding
We'll be comparing the space efficiency of different lossless video compression algorithms and comparing their space efficiency

Note: We are only using uncompressed YUV videos as inputs. This is so that the only compression being applied to the video is the algorithms we apply.
